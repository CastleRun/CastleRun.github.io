    <h1>Reflex</h1>
    <p>Players: 2</p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of the game is to spot cards in specific categories quickly.</p>
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A deck of cards</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Shuffle the deck</li>
      <li>Give 26 cards to each player.</li>
      <li>The game's dealer will be picked randomly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <p>The game has two roles, the <b>dealer</b> and the <b>stealer</b>.</p>
    <p>You will learn what they do later, but the two roles will switch(i.e. the dealer becomes the stealer and the stealer becomes the dealer).</p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Both the dealer and the stealer take a card out of their pile.<br>
      If...<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Both cards are odd(A, 3, 5, 7, 9 and J are all odd cards):</b>The stealer will look for an odd card.</li>
        <li><b>Both cards are even(2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and Q are all odd cards):</b>The stealer will look for an even card.</li>
        <li><b>One card is even and the other is odd:</b>The stealer will take out another card from the top of his pile and look for a card with the same number as that card.</li>
        <li><b>One card is a king(K):</b>The king goes into the Treasure Pile and the stealer will look for an odd card if the other card is odd and an even card if the card is even.</li>
        <li><b>Both cards are kings:</b>The kings will go into the Treasure Pile and Step 1 will be repeated.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The cards outside of both the players' piles and the Treasure Pile will go into the Treasure Pile.</li>
      <li>The dealer will flip out cards until the stealer lays a finger on a card.<br>
      If...
      <ul>
        <li><b>The card is one the cards the stealer is looking for(e.g. any even card if the stealer is looking for an even card): </b>The stealer gets everything in the Treasure Pile plus all the cards from the face-up pile in front of the dealer's pile except the cards below the last card that the stealer was looking for but missed.  These cards go to the dealer.</li>
        <li><b>The card isn't any of these cards: </b>All the cards go to the dealer and the dealer wins.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>If the dealer's pile is empty before the stealer laid his finger on a card, all the cards go to the dealer and the dealer wins.</li>
      <li>The roles of dealer and stealer switch</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 1-5 until someone loses his/her cards(The face-up cards in front of the dealer are also the dealer's cards.).  The person with all the cards at this point wins the game.</li>
    </ol>
